    "# LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you build an agent with LangGraph, you will first break it apart into discrete steps called nodes. Then, you will describe the different decisions and transitions from each of your nodes. Finally, you connect nodes together through a shared state that each node can read from and write to.\n",
    "\n",
    "State is the shared memory accessible to all nodes in your agent. Think of it as the notebook your agent uses to keep track of everything it learns and decides as it works through the process. When you \n",
    "\n",
    "The resilience consideration: LangGraph’s durable execution creates checkpoints at node boundaries. When a workflow resumes after an interruption or failure, it starts from the beginning of the node where execution stopped. Smaller nodes mean more frequent checkpoints, which means less work to repeat if something goes wrong. If you combine multiple operations into one large node, a failure near the end means re-executing everything from the start of that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow vs Agents:\n",
    "1. Workflows have predetermined code paths and are designed to operate in a certain order.\n",
    "2. Agents are dynamic and define their own processes and tool usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Workflow vs Agents](https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ/oss/images/agent_workflow.png?w%3D840%26fit%3Dmax%26auto%3Dformat%26n%3D-_xGPoyjhyiDWTPJ%26q%3D85%26s%3Dae1fa9087b33b9ff8bc3446ccaa23e3d)\n",

    "### LLMs and augmentations\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows and agentic systems are based on LLMs and the various augmentations you add to them. Tool calling, structured outputs, and short term memory are a few options for tailoring LLMs to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt chaining is when each LLM call processes the output of the previous call. It’s often used for performing well-defined tasks that can be broken down into smaller, verifiable steps. Some examples include:\n",
    "Translating documents into different languages\n",
    "Verifying generated content for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "With parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task. This is either done by running multiple independent subtasks at the same time, or running the same task multiple times to check for different outputs. Parallelization is commonly used to:\n",
    "1. Split up subtasks and run them in parallel, which increases speed\n",
    "2. Run tasks multiple times to check for different outputs, which increases confidence\n"
