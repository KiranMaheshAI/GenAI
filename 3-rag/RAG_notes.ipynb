    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Concept:\n",
    "==========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RETRIEVAL: When a user asks a question, the system searches through \n",
    "   a knowledge base (vector store) to find relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AUGMENTATION: The retrieved information is added to the user's question \n",
    "   as context, providing the AI model with relevant background knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GENERATION: The AI model generates a response based on both the original \n",
    "   question and the retrieved context, resulting in more accurate and \n",
    "   informative answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Reduces hallucinations\n",
    "- Provides up-to-date information\n",
    "- Enables domain-specific knowledge\n",
    "- Improves response accuracy\n",
    "Vector Embeddings Explained: ===========================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TEXT TO NUMBERS: Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors \n",
    "   (arrays of numbers) that represent semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SEMANTIC SIMILARITY: Similar texts have similar vector representations.\n",
    "   This allows mathematical comparison of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HIGH DIMENSIONS: Embeddings typically have 384, 768, or 1536 dimensions,\n",
    "   capturing complex relationships between concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DISTANCE METRICS: \n",
    "   - Cosine similarity: Measures angle between vectors\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance: Measures straight-line distance\n",
    "   - Dot product: Measures vector alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"dog\" and \"puppy\" → very similar vectors (high similarity score)\n",
    "\"dog\" and \"computer\" → very different vectors (low similarity score)\n",
    "1. VECTOR STORAGE: Efficiently stores and indexes high-dimensional vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SIMILARITY SEARCH: Fast retrieval of similar vectors using various metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "3. METADATA FILTERING: Attach metadata to vectors for advanced filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MULTIPLE CLIENTS:\n",
    "   - Persistent: Local file-based storage\n",
    "   - HTTP: Remote server deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "5. EMBEDDING FUNCTIONS:\n",
    "   - Default: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (lightweight, fast)\n",
    "   - OpenAI: High-quality commercial embeddings\n",
    "   - SentenceTransformers: Various specialized models\n",
    "   - Custom: Your own embedding functions\n",
    "\n",
    "6. COLLECTIONS: Organize vectors into separate collections/namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "7. PERSISTENCE: Data survives application restarts"
