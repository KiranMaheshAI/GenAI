Langchain is specially used for LLM powered applications.

Langchain  -> Chaining  -> Focus on Sequential Execution of process
* In Langchain, everything happens in sequential order So we call it as Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)

LangGraph: We can create stateful Multi AI Agents Applications where Agents will be communicating with themselves to solve complex workflow.
* They follow the graph structure and it is also going to maintain information which will be shared within the Nodes that is why it is called stategraph.
